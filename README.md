# Research-Paper-Subject-Prediction-with-BERT-Based-NLP-Techniques
### Introduction
The Research Paper Subject Prediction project is an innovative application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to assist researchers, academics, and institutions in automatically categorizing research papers into specific subjects based on their summaries. This project harnesses the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) embeddings to extract rich features from paper summaries and predict their subject categories accurately.

### Project Goals
1. Research Paper Data Collection: The primary objective of this project is to use a diverse and comprehensive dataset of research papers, each accompanied by a summary. The papers should cover a wide array of subjects, domains, and academic disciplines.

2. NLP Feature Extraction: Utilizing NLP techniques, we will preprocess and clean the paper summaries to prepare them for analysis. This preprocessing includes tokenization, stopword removal, and handling special characters and formatting.

3. BERT-Based Embeddings: The core component of this project is the utilization of BERT embeddings to create dense vector representations of the paper summaries. These embeddings capture intricate semantic relationships within the text, enabling a deeper understanding of the content.

4. Subject Prediction: The project aims to predict the subject or category of each research paper based on the BERT embeddings extracted from its summary. This prediction will categorize papers into specific academic disciplines, domains, or research topics.

### Methodology
1. Data Collection: We will use a diverse dataset of research papers, including their summaries, from various sources and academic journals. The dataset should encompass a broad spectrum of research subjects.

2. NLP Preprocessing: The paper summaries will undergo NLP preprocessing, which includes tokenization (breaking text into words or tokens), stopword removal (eliminating common words like "and" or "the"), and formatting cleanup. This prepares the text for feature extraction.

3. BERT Embeddings: BERT embeddings will be extracted from the preprocessed paper summaries using a pre-trained BERT model. These embeddings capture the contextual information and semantic relationships within the text.

4. Subject Prediction: A machine learning model, such as a classification algorithm, will be trained on the BERT embeddings and associated subject labels. The model will predict the subject category for new, unseen paper summaries.

### Deliverables
1. A robust NLP pipeline for preprocessing and feature extraction from research paper summaries.

2. A well-trained BERT-based model for subject prediction.

3. A diverse and comprehensive dataset of research papers with subject labels.

### Conclusion
The Research Paper Subject Prediction project represents a valuable tool for researchers and institutions seeking to categorize and manage large volumes of academic literature efficiently. By leveraging NLP techniques and BERT embeddings, the project enhances the accuracy of subject prediction and showcases the potential of deep learning models in understanding and categorizing research content. This project contributes to the advancement of automated research paper classification and provides a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction with the model.
